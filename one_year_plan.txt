Lofty but big and specific goals

I can want to buy 2 houses in year 1. One for investment purposes and one to live in.
House 1 FHA loan
300k * 3.5% down = 10,500

House 2 Conventional loan
300k * 20% down = 60,000

So my goal is to make 100k in income to afford insurance, and prove that RE is right for me.

Total 170,500

So to make 170500 / .03 (3 percent)= 5,683,333

Average house costs 663,604$
Average number of houses 8.5 houses round up to 9...
