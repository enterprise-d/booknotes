I don't know how effective or accurate a plan for 10 years into the future can be,
but at least I can get some long term goals on paper
The millionaire real estate book suggests putting purpose or Why
Purpose: I want to have make enough money to retire early so I can
    Provide for my family
    Spend quality time with them
    Travel the world

3 million dollars

Why three million equity?

A dividend portfolio in the stock market could potentially provide on average 7 percent ROI
This averages out to 17500 per month
This is nearly 3 times what I make now and can make a decent retirement. Living off the dividends

This averages out to growing 333,333 dollars per year of net worth

Assumptions
300K dollar house average
Principle payments per year 10K
Aquisition costs 15k

Year 1 = 1 house = 10k revenue-15k = -5k            In 9 years, this house adds 75
Year 2 = 3 new houses = 30K revenue - 45k = -15     In 8 years, these houses add 195
Year 3 = 6 new houses = 100k revenue -90 = 10K      In 7 years, these houses add 330
Year 4 = 10 new houses = 200K revenue -150k = 50k   In 6 years, these houses add 450
Year 5 = 15 new housees = 350k revenue - 225k = 125kIn 5 years, these houses add 525
Year 6 = 20 new houses = 550k revenue - 300k = 200K In 4 years, these houses add 500
Year 7 = 25 new houses = 800k revenue - 375k = 425k In 3 years, these houses add 375
Year 9 = 30 new houses = 1.1M revenue - 450K = 650K In 2 years, these houses add 150

After 9 years total equity is
2,600,000

Year 10 no new houses
110 houses * 10K = 1.1M
Total net worth on year 10 is 3.7 million
Can liquidate if you want. But more than likely 1041 exchange to cash flow resort or condo building.
